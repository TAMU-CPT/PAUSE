# PAUSE v2

This is a comlpete re-write of PAUSE based on more standard technologies like
Wig/BigWig and python

## Analysis

This portion is, as of now, completely unimplemented. Eventually we'd like to
automatically annotate the regions (perhaps in GFF, with an IDA code) based on
prior knowledge of what each phage type looks like.
