# PAUSE Report

This report was automatically generated by the PAUSE software. It merely records some information about the analysis process

These regions were examined: 

- 13228..13536
- 31011..9221
- 31011..40108

## Process

 - Discounted region [13228..9221] due to size of region as % of genome
 - Discounted region [13228..11184] due to size of region as % of genome
 - Found possible region on [13228..13536], where the average coverage (136.100649351) is larger than the rest of the genome (72.6990984466)
 - Discounted region [13228..40108] due to size of region as % of genome
 - Discounted region [31011..9221], as average coverage (66.071984331) was not significantly larger than the rest of the genome (41.1969481413)
 - Discounted region [31011..11184] due to size of region as % of genome
 - Discounted region [31011..13536] due to size of region as % of genome
 - Discounted region [31011..40108], as average coverage (32.4922501924) was not significantly larger than the rest of the genome (57.0307262389)

## Conclusions

 - Region [13228..13536] is likely candidate for a repeat_region

## Recommendations

Recommend re-opening the genome at base 13228
